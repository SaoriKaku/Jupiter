Personalized Recommendation Engine for Events
• Front End: implemented an interactive web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX) for users to look for events, purchase
tickets; improved personalized recommendation based on search history and favorite records.
• Back End: created Java Servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.
• Built relational databases MySQL to store real event information (price, location, category, etc.) for consistency and migrated
to NoSQL database MongoDB for better scalability.
• Researched multiple recommendation algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation) to implement recommendations
and evaluate performance (precision vs. recall vs. cost).
• Deployed to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.

Personalized Recommendation Engine for Events

1. Front End: implemented an interactive web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX) for users to look for events, purchase
tickets; improved personalized recommendation based on search history and favorite records.
2. Back End: created Java Servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.
3. Built relational databases MySQL to store real event information (price, location, category, etc.) for consistency and migrated to NoSQL database MongoDB for better scalability.
4. Researched multiple recommendation algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation) to implement recommendations and evaluate performance (precision vs. recall vs. cost).
5. Deployed to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
